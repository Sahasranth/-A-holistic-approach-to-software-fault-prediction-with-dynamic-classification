# -A-holistic-approach-to-software-fault-prediction-with-dynamic-classification

1)Class Imbalance Mitigation: Addressed class imbalance using the Random-Over Sampling technique, improving accuracy for minority-class predictions.

2)Feature Selection Optimization: Utilized Ant-Colony Optimization (ACO) for efficient feature selection to enhance model performance.

3)Dynamic Classifier Ensemble: Introduced a Dynamic Classifier combining multiple machine learning models, achieving 94.129% accuracy in fault prediction.

4)Superior Performance: The proposed approach outperforms standard algorithms like Random Forest and Decision Trees, offering more accurate and efficient fault prediction.
