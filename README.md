# A-holistic-approach-to-software-fault-prediction-with-dynamic-classification

Overview
This research introduces a Dynamic Classifier Model for Software Fault Prediction (SFP) â€” an innovative ensemble-based approach designed to enhance the accuracy and reliability of fault detection in software systems.

Traditional fault prediction methods often face challenges such as class imbalance, suboptimal feature selection, and inconsistent model performance. To overcome these limitations, this study integrates Random Over-Sampling, Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), and Grid Search Hyperparameter Tuning into a unified framework. The proposed approach demonstrates significant improvements over conventional models such as Random Forest and Decision Tree.

Objective
The primary objectives of this study are to:
1.	Mitigate class imbalance in datasets using Random Over-Sampling to improve prediction accuracy for minority classes.
2.	Optimize feature selection through the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm to retain only the most relevant attributes.
3.	Develop a Dynamic Classifier Ensemble that combines multiple machine learning models for robust and adaptive fault prediction.
4.	Achieve superior performance compared to traditional algorithms by improving both accuracy and computational efficiency.

Methodology
1.	Class Imbalance Mitigation:
The dataset imbalance was addressed using the Random Over-Sampling technique. This process increases the representation of minority class samples, which leads to better accuracy and recall for faulty modules.
2.	Feature Selection Optimization:
The Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm was applied to intelligently select features. This reduced the number of dimensions while maintaining essential predictive information, resulting in improved model performance.
3.	Dynamic Classifier Ensemble:
A Dynamic Classifier Model was designed to adaptively select the most suitable base learners and combine their predictions. This ensemble approach achieved an accuracy of 94.129% in software fault prediction.
4.	Model Performance Comparison:
Experimental results showed that the proposed model outperformed standard algorithms like Random Forest and Decision Tree, providing more accurate, reliable, and efficient predictions.


Key Highlights
1.	Implemented Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) for efficient and intelligent feature selection.
2.	Applied Random Over-Sampling to effectively handle class imbalance in fault datasets.
3.	Developed a Dynamic Classifier Ensemble that automatically selects the best-performing model based on accuracy.
4.	Conducted Grid Search Hyperparameter Tuning to achieve optimal model performance.
5.	Achieved an impressive accuracy of 94.129%, surpassing traditional models such as Random Forest and Decision Tree.
6.	Demonstrated that integrating ACO with ensemble learning significantly enhances fault prediction reliability and generalization.
