# A-holistic-approach-to-software-fault-prediction-with-dynamic-classification

This research introduces a Dynamic Classifier model for Software Fault Prediction (SFP)â€”an innovative ensemble approach designed to improve the accuracy and reliability of fault detection in software systems. The study addresses three major challenges in traditional fault prediction methods:
-Class Imbalance in datasets
-Suboptimal Feature Selection
-Inconsistent Model Performance

By integrating Random Over-Sampling, Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), and Grid Search Hyperparameter Tuning, the proposed framework achieves significant improvements over conventional models like Random Forest and Decision Tree.

1)Class Imbalance Mitigation: Addressed class imbalance using the Random-Over Sampling technique, improving accuracy for minority-class predictions.

2)Feature Selection Optimization: Utilized Ant-Colony Optimization (ACO) for efficient feature selection to enhance model performance.

3)Dynamic Classifier Ensemble: Introduced a Dynamic Classifier combining multiple machine learning models, achieving 94.129% accuracy in fault prediction.

4)Superior Performance: The proposed approach outperforms standard algorithms like Random Forest and Decision Trees, offering more accurate and efficient fault prediction.
